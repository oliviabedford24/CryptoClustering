# CryptoClustering

In the Module 19 challenge of Rice University's Data Analytics bootcamp, we used our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The primary code is contained in the "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb" file, and my comments and conclusions are contained therein, as well. The data set being analyzed is contained in the Resources folder. 

The code in this repository is my original work. 

Thank you!
