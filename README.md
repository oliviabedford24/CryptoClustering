# CryptoClustering

In the Module 19 challenge of Rice University's Data Analytics bootcamp, we used our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

The primary code is contained in the "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb" file, and my comments and conclusions are contained therein, as well. The data set being analyzed is contained in the Resources folder. 

The code in this repository is my original work. I obtained assistance and input from Rice University's team of instructors and tutors, but the work itself is mine alone.

Another day, another slay. :)
